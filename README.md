# Ticket Raffle

This project is a simple (but fairly over-engineered ðŸ˜„) means of selecting winners for an upcoming freeCodeCamp London competition to give away three tickets to [this event](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/11735-beyondtech-2019).

I'll run the program to draw the winners once only at the [next meetup](https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-London/events/259680042/) at Skills Matter on 16th April 2019.

Feel free to let me know if I made a mistake in the code by creating an Issue or a PR!

## Rules

1. You must be a member of the freeCodeCamp London Slack group. Click [here](https://tinyurl.com/y8y4b577) to sign up for free.
2. You must attend the meetup on 16th April 2019. See [here](https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-London/events/259680042/) for details. It's free as always!
3. You must be able to commit to attending at least one (preferably both) of the two days of the conference. Please don't enter if you're not certain.

## How to enter

1. Fork this repository by clicking the Fork button in the top right. See [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) if you need help.
2. Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/ticket-raffle.git
cd ticket-raffle
```

3. Add a text file to the /contestants folder. Call it what you want (again, name is fine), and inside add the name you use on the Slack group (don't add any other personally identifiable information).

4. Save and commit your file. Don't add anything else.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'add janedoe.txt'
```

5. Push your branch back to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push
```

6. Make a pull request to the repository on freeCodeCampLondon. Take a look again at the link in step one if you're not sure.

7. Wait for me to approve it, no need to send me a message as it's not first come first served, as long as you get it in by the time we draw the winner on the 16th ðŸ™‚
